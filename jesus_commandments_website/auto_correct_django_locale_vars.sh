# This script will fix all these variables (works only when the same wrong pattern is used as in the example)
#
# When running auto_translate_files.sh Google will translate all django variables in a wrong format:
# By Example:
# msgid "%(model_name)s with this %(field_label)s already exists."
# msgstr "% (Model_name) s mit diesem% (FIELD_LABEL) s ist bereits vorhanden."
#
# 1) We need to change the '% (Model_name) s' to '%(model_name)s'
# 2) We need to change the '</ [A-Za-z]>' to '</[a-z]>'
# 3) We need to change the '<[A-Z]>' to '<[a-z]>'
#
# Known issue: Sometimes Google also translated the variable to a complete different word, in that case we can't fix this automatic
#
